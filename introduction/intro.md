Introduction
============
The NAL Shapes project is a program commisioned by the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL) to show and extract example data shapes
to drive towards better integration of agricultural data. 
The project is a collaboration between the NAL and the [WESO research group](https://www.weso.es/) from the [University of Oviedo]().

# Objective
The objective of the project is to lead towards the creation of agricultural linked data by identifying data shapes.
The project will focus on identifying program demonstration areas for which key data shapes will be identified, generated and published as 
agricultural linked data schemas published in the agschema.org domain.

The agschema shapes will be linked to other agricultural and related linked data schemas such as the [schema.org](https://schema.org/), [bioschemas.org](https://bioschemas.org/). 

# Program demonstration areas
## Cotton
In the cotton program demonstration area we will focus on generating a set of linked data schemas for cotton amd cotton related data, such as data an (local) weather, soil and agricultural techniques and practices.
