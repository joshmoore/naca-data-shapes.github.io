Example linked-data pipeline on Glioblastoma data
=======
Glioblastoma is one of the program demonstration area's of the ΔTissue project. In this chapter we demonstrate how
tabular data on glioblastoma can be converted to RDF and linked to other data sources.
We use synthetic data provided to us by the two teams working on Glioblastoma as an example.

These are:
- [dataset on Glioblastoma by the team of Stéphane Pagès](data/glioblastoma-pagès.csv)
- [dataset on Glioblastoma by the team of Omer Bayraktar](data/glioblastoma-bayraktar.csv)

This pipeline towards linked data on Glioblastoma is based on the following steps:
1. Inspecting the data and initial data cleaning
2. Identifying the possible ontologies to use
3. Converting the data to RDF
4. Linking the data to other data sources
5. Provide example queries
