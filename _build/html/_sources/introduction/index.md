Introduction to Linked Data
======
Linked data is a common term used to talk about data that is structured in a way that allows it to be connected to other data. This is done by using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify things in the data. These URIs are then used to link data together. This is a very simple way to think about linked data, but it is a powerful concept that can be used to connect data from many different sources.

Other, more or less synonymous terms for linked data are: the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), [Web of Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_data), [Linked Open Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data), and [Open Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_linked_data). These terms are often used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the same. The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) has a [page](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) that describes the differences between these terms.

While there are slight differences between these terms, we will use them interchangeably in this tutorial. We will also use the term "linked data" to refer to the data that is connected by URIs.
